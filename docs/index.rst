This is the documentation of **perfmum**.


**perfmum** is a set of utilities allowing developers to manage performance
benchmarks. A benchmark is made of several steps::

1. build
2. execution
3. metrics extraction and archiving
4. analytics and monitoring

**perfmum** is named that way because it provides everything required to 
manage those steps.

.. note::

    perfmum specifications are currently being edited, available in the
    :ref:`specifications` page. If you think this utility can help you, add your use-case in the dedicated section!
